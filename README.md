# spring-security
 
this project is part of my spring boot learning path
where i'm trying to tackle every major subject of this amazing framework to cover all the bases and improve my productivity
my main focus on this project was spring boot security :

1/basic auth


2/form-auth


3/jwt (work in progress)

every implementation is in a separate git-branch
